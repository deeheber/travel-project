Changes:
  -Added top margin to activities.html, resources.html & aboutus.html to eliminate overlap with header.
  -Reorganized index.css so that page format selectors are in the same order as the navbar links.
  -Edited gallery.js by inserting truthiness test for getElementById('gallery') so script does not run on pages without 'gallery' id element (resolved resource not found error in console on pages without 'gallery').
  -Relocated iframe element in resources.html & assigned id and placeholder background color.
  -Added white text-shadow on hover over links in resources.html.
  -Inserted content div in resources.html and assigned 'display: flex'.
  -Added margin-top: 25px to footer.
  -Preliminaryily relocated gallery to resources.html.
